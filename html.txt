<h3>his career</h3>
<p>Stan Lee was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. 
He rose through the ranks of a family-run business to become Marvel Comics' 
primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a multimedia
 corporation that dominated the comics industry.

<p>In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writer/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created numerous
 popular fictional characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow, 
the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man.
 The superheroes he created seemed more meaningful and realistic.
 In doing so, he pioneered a more naturalistic approach to writing superhero comics in the 1960s, 
and in the 1970s he challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority,</p>
